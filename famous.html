	<blockquote cite="http://sqlanywhere.blogspot.com/2011/10/thursday-quote-barbara-liskov-valerie.html">
	"...The ingredients that have to be in place in order to get an ah hah moment. You have to be working on a problem, but also have to be able to have "off time" so that the brain can work on the back burner."</blockquote>


	<p>Liskov helped develop and implement programming languages like CLU, the first programming language to support data abstraction. CLU has become like a guidebook for other programming languages, such as Java, which borrow from its syntax and semantics. She also helped develop Argus, a high-level language designed to support the construction and maintenance of distributed programs.</p>

	<p>Elon Musk is referred to as the real Iron Man. He is best known as the famous CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX however, he got his start with computers. At the age of 12, he began teaching himself to program which lead him to the launch of his first company, Zip2. But he didn't stop there and he went on to become a co-founder of a company that later became PayPal, which allowed him to strike conversations with the brain-children behind Tesla Motors.</p>

	<p>Can you go a week without Googling something? We have Larry Page and co-founder Sergey Brin to thank for the efficient search engine. While at Stanford, Page started Google as a research project, and Brin joined in. The two soon discovered that their project could be used to build a search engine the likes of which no one had ever seen.</p>

	<blockquote cite="https://www.azquotes.com/author/46455-Guido_van_Rossum">"Phython is an experiment in how much freedom programmers need. Too much freedom and nobody can read another's code; too little and expressiveness is endangered."</blockquote>

	<p>Have you heard of Python? It is the most popular coiding language of 2015 according to codeeval. Python is known for its versatility and is used by countless programmers and companies including Spotify and Dropbox. Guido Van Rossum made Phython.
