	<h1> Postsecondary opportunities and careers in information systems and computer science</h1>



	<h2>Computer science</h2>
	<p><strong>Computer science</strong> is the study of computers and computing, including their theoretical and algorithmic foundations, hardware and software, and their uses for processing information. The discipline of computer science includes the study of algorithms and data structures, computer and network design, modeling data and information processes, and artificial intelligence. Computer science draws some of its foundations from mathematics and engineering and therefore incorporates techniques from areas such as queueing theory, probability and statistics, and electronic circuit desin.<br><br>

	Computer science is one of the most popular study areas at Canadian universities. Graduates of these courses are highly sought-after, and may expect exciting career opportunities.</p>

	<h2>Information system</h2>
	<p><strong>Information system</strong> is an academic study of systems with a specific reference to information and the complementary networks of hardware and software that people and organizations use to collect, filter, process, create and also distribute data.<br><br> Every organization and field of study relies on computers inorder to succeed in today's hyper-digital age. As an information system joint major, you will look for better ways to accomplish tasks using computing technologies, exploring how to processes, manages, and communicates information. Over the course of your degree, you will develop a unique understanding of technical subjects such as databases, networks, data visualization, and telecommunications, as well as non-technical matters such as ethics, law, and digital culture.</p>
